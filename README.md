# go-leetcode

A comprehensive collection of 131 [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/) problems solved in [Go](https://golang.org/), including the complete Top 75 curated list plus 63 additional problems across all difficulty levels.

Each directory includes a:
- Description with link to LeetCode problem
- Solution to the problem
- Unit test

Note that each of these problems **have passed** their respective test cases on LeetCode. The unit 
tests included with each solution in this repo are not comprehensive. They serve as a quick way to 
drop in a test case, hook up the debugger, and step through the algorithms to build understanding. 

Also note that some of my personal comments are in the solutions. I'll be working to clean up 
anything that is not insightful.
